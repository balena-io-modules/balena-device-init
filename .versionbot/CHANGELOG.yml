        Should've done this originally really. It'd be nice to also fix the
        underlying streaming bug (which segfaults when trying to stream a
        missing file through ext2fs), but this fixes the issue, and we'll want
        this change regardless.

        This gives external clients a lot more flexibility about how they
        generate config, and also opens the door for image configuration for
        non-Resin.io ResinOS usage.
